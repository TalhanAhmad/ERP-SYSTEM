# Migrations

18th additive migration: 20261111010000_finance_access_foundation. Creates only FinanceGrant, FinanceAuditEvent, indexes/checks/retention FKs, audit immutability trigger and RLS/runtime privileges. No existing column/data rewrite or grant backfill.

Applied only to loopback encova_test for verification. Hosted Supabase remains on the original 17 migrations. No live migration/deployment is authorized merely by the supplied document. supabase/setup.sql now excludes Finance-prefixed tables from generic CRUD grants and explicitly reapplies the narrower access permissions; tests rehearse it twice.

Before a later rollout: rehearse clean migration/restore, inspect runtime privileges, back up separately, deploy behind a disabled feature gate and obtain a separate finance release decision. Prefer forward additive correction; never delete posted history as rollback.
